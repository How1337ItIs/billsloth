- [ ] Document compatibility issues

### Phase Plan Overview

#### Phase 0: Foundation Testing (Week 1)
**Objective**: Validate TmuxAI compatibility with Bill Sloth modules

#### Phase 1: ISO Preparation (Week 2) 
**Objective**: Create custom Bill Sloth ISO with TmuxAI integration
- Set up Cubic for ISO customization
- Integrate TmuxAI into chroot environment
- Add Bill Sloth wallpapers and themes
- Configure autostart scripts

#### Phase 2: Auto-Install Integration (Week 3)
**Objective**: Enable zero-interaction installation
- Create Ventoy USB with Windows + Bill Sloth
- Implement blivet-based partitioning
- Configure cloud-init for post-install
- Test automated installation flow

#### Phase 3: Production Validation (Week 4)
**Objective**: Validate all modules and prepare for merge
- Test all 30+ modules with TmuxAI
- Performance testing and optimization
- User documentation creation
- Merge criteria validation

- `tests/integration/performance-benchmarks.sh` - Latency and resource tests

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All 30+ Bill Sloth modules launch successfully with TmuxAI
- [ ] Claude provides contextual assistance without breaking workflow
- [ ] Interactive menus respond naturally with AI guidance
- [ ] Error handling and debugging work seamlessly
- [ ] Voice integration continues to function (with fallback if needed)

### Aesthetic Requirements  
- [ ] 100% ASCII art preservation (pirates, skulls, sloths, cyberpunk themes)
- [ ] 100% ANSI color code fidelity (256-color support maintained)
- [ ] Animation and loading effects work correctly
- [ ] Module-specific personality themes intact
- [ ] Visual layouts and spacing preserved

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] <200ms additional latency for TmuxAI integration
- [ ] <10% CPU overhead during normal operation
- [ ] Fallback usage <10% of total sessions
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits for target hardware

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Natural, non-intrusive AI assistance
- [ ] Hotkeys don't conflict with existing module shortcuts
- [ ] Educational explanations feel integrated, not forced
- [ ] Easy toggle between AI-assisted and native modes
- [ ] Clear indication when AI is providing suggestions

## Testing Strategy

### Representative Module Testing
Testing will focus on modules from each category:

1. **ASCII Art Heavy**: data_hoarding_interactive.sh (pirate theme)
2. **Color Intensive**: defensive_cyber_interactive.sh (cyberpunk)
3. **Interactive Complex**: automation_mastery_interactive.sh (menus)
4. **Real-time Updates**: system_doctor_interactive.sh (live data)
5. **Voice Integration**: voice_assistant_interactive.sh (special handling)

### Compatibility Matrix
| Module Type | TmuxAI Compatibility | Visual Preservation | Special Requirements |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Standard Interactive | Expected: 100% | Expected: 100% | None |
| ASCII Art Heavy | Expected: 95% | Expected: 100% | Extended context window |
| Voice Integration | Expected: 80% | Expected: 100% | Fallback mode |
| Real-time Monitoring | Expected: 90% | Expected: 100% | Update throttling |
| Privileged Operations | Expected: 95% | Expected: 100% | Sudo awareness |

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **TmuxAI context window overflow** with large ASCII art blocks
2. **Voice module interference** with PTY handling
3. **Performance degradation** on lower-end hardware
4. **Hotkey conflicts** between TmuxAI and Bill Sloth
5. **Complex animation breakage** in real-time modules

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Extended context configuration** for large art blocks
2. **Selective module exclusion** for voice integration
3. **Configurable performance modes** for different hardware
4. **Careful hotkey mapping** with user customization
5. **Fallback mode** for problematic modules

## Rollback Plan

### If Integration Fails
1. **Immediate**: Switch back to main branch
2. **Partial**: Disable TmuxAI for specific problematic modules
3. **Fallback**: Use PTY-relay approach for edge cases
4. **Emergency**: Revert to Claude Interactive Bridge dual-mode

### Data Protection
- All existing modules remain unchanged during testing
- Backup configurations before any system modifications
- Version control for all integration code
- Easy restoration of original functionality

## Communication Plan

### Development Updates
- Weekly progress reports on integration status
- Immediate notification of blocking issues
- Success/failure documentation for each phase
- User feedback collection and incorporation

### User Involvement
- Beta testing with representative workflows
- Feedback collection on AI assistance quality
- Performance impact assessment on real usage
- Feature request and improvement suggestions
