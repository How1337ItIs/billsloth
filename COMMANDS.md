## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Let modules adapt**: Rate experiences honestly so they learn your workflow
2. **Use AI features sparingly**: Most operations work great without tokens
3. **Customize gradually**: Start with defaults, adapt as you learn preferences
4. **Explore workflows**: Try `launch-workflow` to discover automation possibilities
5. **Monitor satisfaction**: Run `adapt-modules status` weekly to optimize experience

**Remember**: This system learns YOUR workflow. The more you use it honestly, the better it becomes! üß†‚ú®
