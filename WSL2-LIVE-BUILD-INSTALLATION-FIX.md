# WSL2 Live-Build Installation Fix

**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Root Cause:** live-build package not installed in WSL2 Ubuntu  
**Status:** SOLUTION IDENTIFIED - Simple package installation required  
**Disk Space:** ✅ Sufficient (955GB available in WSL2)

## Problem Diagnosis Complete

### Issue Found
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "which lb"
# Returns: (nothing) - command not found
```

### Disk Space Status
```
WSL2 Internal: 955GB available (1% used)
Windows C: Drive: 515GB available (73% used)
```
**✅ SUFFICIENT** - ISO build requires ~20GB

## Fix Required

### Install Live-Build in WSL2
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y live-build git curl debootstrap
    which lb
    lb --version
"
```

### Verify Installation
After installation, test basic functionality:
```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "
    mkdir -p /tmp/test-lb && cd /tmp/test-lb
    lb config --distribution jammy --architecture amd64
    echo 'Live-build config test - Exit code:' $?
    ls -la config/
"
```

## Why Script Failed

1. **Script attempted to use `lb config`** but command doesn't exist
2. **WSL2 environment returned exit code -1** when bash script failed
3. **PowerShell correctly caught the error** and displayed "NO FALLBACK!"
4. **No silent fallback occurred** - working as designed

## Next Steps

1. **Install live-build packages** in WSL2 Ubuntu
2. **Re-run the custom ISO builder** 
3. **Monitor build progress** (should take 20-60 minutes)
4. **Verify ISO creation** at expected location

## User Impact Resolution

**Before Fix:**
- Custom ISO: ❌ Not created
- Build time: ❌ Failed immediately  
- User suspicion: ✅ Correct - process was too fast

**After Fix:**
- Custom ISO: ✅ Should be created successfully
- Build time: ✅ Will take proper 20-60 minutes
- User requirement: ✅ Custom Bill Sloth cyberpunk ISO delivered

**Status:** Simple fix identified - install live-build in WSL2  
**Confidence:** High - WSL2 architecture is correct, just missing packages  
**Next Action:** Install packages and re-run build process
