# 🚀 BILL SLOTH SETUP - SUPER SIMPLE

## Hey Bill! Get Your Digital Command Center Running 🦥

**Two options - pick what feels right:**

---

## Option 1: Let Claude Code Do Everything (Recommended) 🤖

1. **Install Claude Code** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Copy and paste this magic prompt:**
   ```bash
   claude "I want to set up the Bill Sloth digital command center system. Please:
   1) Download it from https://github.com/How1337ItIs/billsloth.git to a folder called 'bill sloth'
   2) Install any missing dependencies it needs
   3) Make everything executable and ready to run
   4) Start the command center for me and KEEP IT RUNNING so I can use it
   5) Show me the menu and explain what each option does
   
   I'm on Ubuntu Linux and want this system for productivity, automation, and managing my single VRBO property called 'Guntersville Getaway'. I also do modding work and business development activities. Please explain each step as you do it."
   ```

3. **That's it!** Claude will handle everything and explain what's happening.

---

## Option 2: Manual Setup (If Claude Code isn't working)

**Just copy-paste these 3 commands:**

```bash
# Download Bill Sloth
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/How1337ItIs/billsloth.git "bill sloth" && cd "bill sloth"

# Make it runnable
chmod +x bill_command_center.sh

# Start it up!
./bill_command_center.sh
```

The system will automatically install anything it needs on first run.
