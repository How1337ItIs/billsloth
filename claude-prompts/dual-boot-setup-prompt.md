# Bill's One-Click Dual-Boot Setup Prompt

Copy and paste this entire prompt into Claude Code:

---

**Help me set up dual-boot Ubuntu on my Windows system using the Bill Sloth automation suite. I need you to handle the technical details and make this as automated as possible.**

**What I want you to do:**

1. **Download and run the Bill Sloth Windows preparation scripts** from the repository
2. **Analyze my Windows system** for dual-boot compatibility 
3. **Help me prepare partitions safely** without data loss
4. **Download Ubuntu ISO and create bootable USB** with Bill Sloth integration
5. **Guide me through the process** with clear, ADHD-friendly instructions
6. **Handle errors and troubleshooting** if anything goes wrong

**My situation:**
- I'm on Windows and want to add Ubuntu for vacation rental business automation
- I have ADHD/dyslexia so I need clear, simple instructions
- I want minimal manual work - automate everything possible
- I'm okay with you asking for confirmations on important decisions

**Please start by:**
1. Downloading the Bill Sloth auto-setup script
2. Running it to get the system preparation tools
3. Beginning the automated system analysis

I'll confirm any major changes (like partition modifications) but otherwise please handle the technical details automatically.

**Start now and let me know what you're doing at each step.**

```

### Step 2: Monitor Progress  
Claude Code watches for status updates and explains what's happening:
