## üìã STEP 1: Install Essential Tools (30 minutes)

### 1.1 Install Git (Required to download Bill Sloth)

**What is Git?** Git lets you download code projects from the internet.

3. **Run the installer** with these settings:
   - ‚úÖ Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt
   - ‚úÖ Use the native Windows Secure Channel library
   - ‚úÖ Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings
   - ‚úÖ Use Windows' default console window
   - ‚úÖ Default (fast-forward or merge)
   - ‚úÖ Git Credential Manager
   - ‚úÖ Enable file system caching
4. **Finish installation** and close the installer

**Test it worked:**

3. Type: `git --version` and press Enter
4. You should see something like: `git version 2.43.0.windows.1`

## üìã STEP 2: Download Bill Sloth Project (10 minutes)

### 2.1 Choose Where to Put Bill Sloth

**Recommended location:** `C:\Users\YourName\bill-sloth`

1. **Open Command Prompt** (as Administrator)
2. **Navigate to your user folder:**
   ```cmd
   cd %USERPROFILE%
   ```

## üìã STEP 3: Run Windows Setup (1-2 hours)

### 3.1 Open PowerShell as Administrator

**Important:** PowerShell is different from Command Prompt - we need PowerShell for the setup scripts.

1. **Press Windows Key**
2. **Type:** `powershell`
3. **Right-click** on "Windows PowerShell"
4. **Choose** "Run as administrator"
5. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for permission

### 3.2 Allow Scripts to Run

**What this does:** By default, Windows blocks scripts for security. We need to allow them.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Type `Y` and press Enter when it asks for confirmation.

### 3.3 Navigate to Windows Setup

```powershell
cd "%USERPROFILE%\bill-sloth\windows-setup"
```

### 3.4 Run the Complete Setup

**RECOMMENDED - Complete System Creator:**
```powershell
.\bill-sloth-complete-system-creator.ps1
```

**OR Traditional Setup:**
```powershell
.\bill-sloth-claude-assisted-setup.ps1 -Interactive
```

**What the Complete System Creator does:**
- Auto-detects Ubuntu ISO files and USB drives
- Creates bootable Ubuntu USB with Rufus
- Installs complete Bill Sloth automation system on USB
- Creates auto-launch scripts for immediate activation
- Includes onboarding, command center, and all modules
- ADHD/dyslexia optimized with ASCII-only output

**What the Traditional Setup does:**
- Analyzes your computer for dual-boot compatibility  
- Helps prepare your hard drive for Ubuntu
- Downloads Ubuntu installer
- Creates a bootable USB drive
- Sets up everything with AI assistance

**Follow the prompts** - the script will:
- Ask questions about what you want to do
- Show you what it found on your computer
- Recommend how much space to use for Ubuntu
- Guide you through each step

### 3.5 If Something Goes Wrong

**"Script not found" error:**
```powershell
# Check you're in the right place
dir
# You should see files like bill-sloth-claude-assisted-setup.ps1
```

**"Execution policy" error:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

**"Claude not found" error:**
- Close PowerShell
- Open new PowerShell as Administrator
- Try again

## üìã STEP 4: Create Ubuntu USB and Install (30-60 minutes)

### 4.1 USB Creation

The setup script will:
1. **Download Ubuntu ISO** (about 4GB - takes 10-30 minutes depending on internet)
2. **Create bootable USB** (needs an 8GB+ USB drive)
3. **Add Bill Sloth startup files** to the USB

**You'll need:**
- USB drive (8GB or larger) - **will be completely erased**
- About 1-2 hours of uninterrupted time

### 4.2 Install Ubuntu

1. **Insert the USB drive** the script created
2. **Restart your computer**
3. **Boot from USB** (usually press F12, F2, or Del during startup)
4. **Choose "Install Ubuntu"**
5. **Select "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows"** (dual-boot option)
6. **Follow the installation wizard**

**Important settings:**
- ‚úÖ Download updates during installation
- ‚úÖ Install third-party software
- Username: whatever you want
- Password: something you'll remember!

### 4.3 First Boot into Ubuntu

After Ubuntu installs:
1. **Restart** and choose Ubuntu from the boot menu
2. **Open Terminal** (Ctrl+Alt+T)
3. **Navigate to the Bill Sloth startup files:**
   ```bash
   cd /media/*/UBUNTU*/bill-sloth-startup/
   ```
4. **Run the setup:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-bill-sloth.sh
   ./setup-bill-sloth.sh
   ```

## üìã STEP 5: Complete Bill Sloth Setup in Ubuntu (30-60 minutes)

### 5.1 Run Dependency Installation

```bash
cd ~/bill-sloth
./scripts/linux_dependency_validator.sh
```

If there are missing dependencies:
```bash
./scripts/dependency_installer.sh
```

### 5.2 Run Deployment Readiness Check

```bash
./scripts/deployment_readiness_check.sh
```

This checks if everything is ready to go.

### 5.3 Set Up Local AI (Optional but Recommended)

```bash

```

Choose option 1 (Express Setup) for most people.

### 5.4 Start Bill Sloth
