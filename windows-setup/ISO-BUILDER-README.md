  - ‚úÖ Bill Sloth automation pre-integrated
  - ‚úÖ Development environment setup via first-boot installer
  - ‚úÖ No fallback to standard Ubuntu
  - ‚úÖ 10-15 minute build time (extraction/modification is fast)

## ‚ùå **BROKEN BUILDERS - DO NOT USE**

### `bill-sloth-broken-package-install.ps1` ‚ùå **BROKEN**
- **Issue:** Package installation fails in live-build chroot
- **Error:** `E: Unable to locate package` errors
- **Result:** Creates base system but packages don't install

### `bill-sloth-broken-package-install-v2.ps1` ‚ùå **BROKEN**  
- **Issue:** Same package installation problems
- **Error:** Same apt package location failures
- **Result:** Also fails during package installation

## üöÄ **How to Use the Working Builder**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Windows with WSL2 enabled
   - Ubuntu-22.04 installed in WSL2
   - Run as Administrator

2. **Command:**
   ```powershell
   cd "windows-setup"
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "bill-sloth-RECOMMENDED-iso-builder.ps1"
   ```

3. **What happens:**
   - Creates WSL2 build environment
   - Builds custom Ubuntu base system

4. **First boot experience:**
   - System automatically runs setup
   - Installs development tools
   - Clones Bill Sloth repository
   - Configures automation system
   - Ready to use with `bill` command

## üîß **Technical Details**

**Why the "recommended" builder works:**
- Avoids live-build package installation bugs
- Uses first-boot installation (with internet access)
- Packages install reliably outside chroot environment
- Creates bootable custom ISO successfully

**Why others are broken:**
- Try to install packages during ISO build
- live-build chroot can't find Ubuntu packages
- Build process fails at package installation step
- Never creates final ISO file

## ü¶•‚ö° **Result**

The recommended builder creates a **real custom Bill Sloth Cyberpunk Ubuntu ISO** that:
- Boots into custom-branded Ubuntu system
- Automatically sets up development environment
- Integrates Bill Sloth automation
- No fallback to standard Ubuntu
- Complete neurodivergent-friendly experience

**Use only the RECOMMENDED builder for guaranteed success!**
