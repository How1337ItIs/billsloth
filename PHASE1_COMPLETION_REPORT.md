- **Category breakdown** showing scores by component type
- **Actionable suggestions** for fixing issues
- **Better user feedback** with clear next steps

### 5. 🤖 Ollama Utilities (`lib/ollama_utils.sh`)
- **Complete model management** (install, remove, test, list)
- **System requirements** checking before installation
- **Recommended models** for different use cases
- **Quick setup** for new users
- **Service management** (start, stop, status)
- **Default model** configuration

### 6. 🖥️ System Detection (`lib/system_utils.sh`)
- **Comprehensive hardware detection** (VRAM, RAM, CPU, storage)
- **Multiple VRAM detection methods** (nvidia-smi, lspci, glxinfo)
- **Requirement checking** for different tasks (AI models, gaming, etc.)
- **Cached results** for performance (1-hour cache)
- **JSON reporting** with complete system information
