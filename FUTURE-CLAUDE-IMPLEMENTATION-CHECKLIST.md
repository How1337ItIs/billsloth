# ‚úÖ Future Claude Instance Implementation Checklist

**Purpose:** Practical checklist to prevent ISO builder-type issues in complex integrations  
**Use when:** Working on PowerShell + WSL2 + Linux or similar multi-system projects

---

## üö® **Pre-Implementation Checklist**

### **Before You Start ANY Complex Integration:**

- [ ] **Read the prevention guidelines** - Review `FUTURE-PREVENTION-GUIDELINES.md`
- [ ] **Identify all system layers** - List every system involved (PowerShell ‚Üí WSL2 ‚Üí Ubuntu)
- [ ] **Document platform versions** - Record exact versions of all components
- [ ] **Verify file paths exist** - Check that assumed paths actually exist
- [ ] **Plan cleanup strategy** - How will you handle leftover state?
- [ ] **Define success metrics** - What quantifiable results indicate success?

### **Red Flag Questions (If "No" to any, STOP and investigate):**
- [ ] Do I know the exact platform versions I'm targeting?
- [ ] Have I verified that assumed file paths actually exist?
- [ ] Do I have a plan for cleaning up previous build artifacts?
- [ ] Have I defined measurable success criteria?
- [ ] Do I have fallback methods if the primary approach fails?

## üîß **Implementation Phase Checklist**

### **For Each Major Component:**

#### **Step 1: Individual Layer Testing**
- [ ] **PowerShell syntax** - Does the PowerShell script parse cleanly?
- [ ] **WSL2 communication** - Can PowerShell execute WSL2 commands?
- [ ] **Linux operations** - Do the Linux commands work in isolation?
- [ ] **File system access** - Can each layer access required files?

#### **Step 2: Integration Testing**
- [ ] **Cross-system paths** - Do file paths resolve correctly across systems?
- [ ] **Data flow** - Does information pass correctly between layers?
- [ ] **Error propagation** - Do errors surface properly through all layers?
- [ ] **State management** - Does each layer handle state correctly?

#### **Step 3: End-to-End Validation**
- [ ] **Complete workflow** - Does the entire process complete successfully?
- [ ] **Output validation** - Are the results quantifiably correct?
- [ ] **Size/count checks** - Do metrics match expected ranges?
- [ ] **Functional testing** - Does the final output actually work?

### **Required Code Patterns:**

#### **‚úÖ State Management Pattern:**
```powershell
# ALWAYS implement aggressive cleanup
wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "sudo rm -rf /tmp/build-* 2>/dev/null || true"

# Use unique identifiers
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd-HHmmss"
$buildDir = "/tmp/build-$timestamp"
```
- [ ] Implemented aggressive cleanup
- [ ] Using unique directory names
- [ ] Added error suppression for cleanup commands

#### **‚úÖ Validation Pattern:**
```powershell
# ALWAYS validate with quantifiable metrics
$fileCount = (wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "find $buildDir -type f | wc -l").Trim()
if ([int]$fileCount -lt $expectedMinimum) {
    Write-Host "ERROR: Validation failed" -ForegroundColor Red
    exit 1
}
```
- [ ] Implemented quantifiable validation
- [ ] Defined minimum thresholds
- [ ] Added clear error messages with specifics

#### **‚úÖ Checkpoint Pattern:**
```powershell
# Break complex operations into verified steps
Write-Host "Step 1: Initial setup..." -ForegroundColor Green
# ... operations ...
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Write-Host "Step 1 failed"; exit 1 }

# Verify step completion before proceeding
$verification = wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 bash -c "test -f $expectedFile && echo 'OK'"
if ($verification -ne "OK") { Write-Host "Step 1 verification failed"; exit 1 }
```
- [ ] Added progress indicators for major steps
- [ ] Implemented verification after each step
- [ ] Added early exit on step failures

## üìã **Platform-Specific Checklists**

### **For Ubuntu/Linux Integration:**

#### **Boot Structure Verification (for ISO builders):**
- [ ] **Check Ubuntu version** - `lsb_release -a` to confirm version
- [ ] **Verify GRUB files exist** - `/boot/grub/i386-pc/eltorito.img`
- [ ] **Verify EFI files exist** - `/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi`
- [ ] **Test xorriso availability** - Command exists and works
- [ ] **Check for legacy paths** - Ensure not using obsolete ISOLINUX paths

#### **File System Operations:**
- [ ] **Test unsquashfs with force flag** - `unsquashfs -f` for conflicts
- [ ] **Verify mount points work** - Can mount/unmount reliably
- [ ] **Check file permissions** - Proper sudo access where needed
- [ ] **Test large file operations** - Can handle GB-sized files

### **For PowerShell + WSL2 Integration:**

#### **Communication Verification:**
- [ ] **WSL2 distribution exists** - `wsl -l -v` shows target distro
- [ ] **Basic commands work** - `wsl -d [distro] echo "test"`
- [ ] **File system access** - Can access Windows files from WSL2
- [ ] **Path conversion** - Windows paths work in WSL2 context

#### **Error Handling:**
- [ ] **Exit codes propagate** - PowerShell sees Linux command failures
- [ ] **Error messages clear** - Failures give actionable information
- [ ] **Timeout handling** - Long operations don't hang indefinitely
- [ ] **Resource cleanup** - Failed operations clean up properly

## üìä **Testing Validation Checklist**

### **Before Claiming "WORKING":**

#### **Required Test Evidence:**
- [ ] **Syntax validation** - Script parses without errors
- [ ] **Process completion** - All major steps complete successfully
- [ ] **Quantified results** - File counts, sizes, etc. meet thresholds
- [ ] **Functional testing** - Final output actually works as intended
- [ ] **Clean environment test** - Works on system without previous runs

#### **Documentation Requirements:**
- [ ] **Test date recorded** - When was this actually tested?
- [ ] **Platform versions** - Exact versions of all components
- [ ] **Test procedure** - Reproducible steps for verification
- [ ] **Actual results** - Quantified metrics from test run
- [ ] **Known limitations** - What wasn't tested or doesn't work?

#### **Evidence Format:**
```markdown
## [Component] Test Results

## üö´ **Final Prevention Checklist**

### **Before Marking as Complete:**

#### **Review for Common Anti-Patterns:**
- [ ] **No assumptions without verification** - All paths/versions confirmed
- [ ] **No complex here-strings** - Individual commands instead
- [ ] **No state pollution** - Aggressive cleanup implemented
- [ ] **No untested claims** - All "WORKING" status backed by evidence
- [ ] **No missing fallbacks** - Alternative methods for critical operations

#### **Documentation Quality Check:**
- [ ] **Status claims dated** - Include when last tested
- [ ] **Platform versions explicit** - Not generic "Ubuntu" but "Ubuntu-22.04.5"
- [ ] **Test procedures included** - Others can reproduce the tests
- [ ] **Limitations noted** - Clear about what wasn't tested
- [ ] **Success criteria defined** - Quantifiable measures of success

#### **Future-Proofing:**
- [ ] **Version-specific notes** - Document platform version dependencies
- [ ] **Update triggers** - Note when revalidation needed
- [ ] **Migration paths** - How to handle platform updates
- [ ] **Contact information** - Who to ask if issues arise

## üéØ **Quick Reference Card**

### **The Big 4 Prevention Rules:**
1. **üîç VERIFY FIRST** - Check versions and paths before assuming
2. **üßπ CLEAN AGGRESSIVELY** - Remove all previous state
3. **‚úÖ VALIDATE QUANTIFIABLY** - Use measurable success criteria  
4. **üìù DOCUMENT EVIDENCE** - Record actual test results with dates

### **Emergency Questions:**
- What platform versions am I actually targeting?
- Do the file paths I'm using actually exist?
- How am I handling leftover state from previous runs?
- What measurable criteria define success?
- When was this last actually tested end-to-end?
