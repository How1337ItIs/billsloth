## Unique Bill Sloth Features

### 1. **Adaptive Learning System**
No other project found has modules that self-modify based on user feedback. This is Bill Sloth's killer feature.

### 2. **Token-Efficient Feedback**
The 1-6 rating system using zero tokens is innovative and not seen in other projects.

### 3. **Windows Power-User Equivalents**
No other Linux assistant specifically targets Windows power users with familiar tool equivalents:
- ClipboardFusion → `clipboard_mastery_interactive`
- Everything → `file_mastery_interactive`
- PowerToys Run → `launcher_mastery_interactive`

### 4. **ADHD-First Design**
While some projects mention accessibility, none are designed specifically for ADHD brains with:
- Visual progress tracking
- Dopamine-optimized feedback
- Focus mode integration
- External brain systems

### 5. **Integrated Hacking Toolkit**
The `defensive_cyber_interactive` module provides a complete ethical hacking environment not found in other assistants.
