# CLI Pane Bridge - Documentation Stub

## Overview
TODO: Document the CLI Pane Bridge system that enables Claude Code CLI integration with Bill Sloth modules while preserving full visual experience.

## Problem Statement
- Claude Code's Bash tool only shows tiny output previews
- Bill Sloth's ASCII art, colors, and animations are lost
- Need Claude "inside" terminal experience, not "outside" running it

## Solution Architecture
TODO: Document the tmux-based split-pane approach:
- Left pane: Bill Sloth module with full visuals
- Right pane: Claude Code CLI with context awareness
- Cross-platform support (Ubuntu, WSL2, Windows Terminal)

## Installation
TODO: Document installation and setup procedures

## Usage
TODO: Document how to use the CLI pane bridge with Bill Sloth modules

## Cross-Platform Support
TODO: Document platform-specific implementations:
- Linux/WSL2: tmux-based solution
- Windows: Windows Terminal split-pane fallback

## Troubleshooting
TODO: Document common issues and solutions

## API Reference
TODO: Document wrapper scripts and configuration options
