# 🎯 Ubuntu Installation Menu Choices - Step-by-Step Guide

**For:** Bill's ASUS system dual-boot setup  
**Context:** After fixing boot crash with `nomodeset acpi=off` parameters  
**Goal:** Successful Ubuntu installation alongside Windows without data loss

---

## 🚀 **BOOT MENU CHOICES**

### **Initial GRUB Menu (From USB):**
```
✅ SELECT: "Try or Install Ubuntu"
❌ AVOID: "Ubuntu (safe graphics)" (unless boot parameters don't work)

IMPORTANT: Press 'e' to edit and add boot parameters if needed:
- Add: nomodeset acpi=off
- Press Ctrl+X to boot
```

---

## 🌍 **LANGUAGE AND REGION SETUP**

### **Welcome Screen:**
```
✅ SELECT: "English" (or Bill's preferred language)
✅ CLICK: "Install Ubuntu" (not "Try Ubuntu")

If trying first:
✅ CLICK: "Try Ubuntu" → Test system → Then double-click "Install Ubuntu"
```

### **Keyboard Layout:**
```
✅ SELECT: "English (US)" (or Bill's layout)
✅ TEST: Type in the test box to verify
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Updates and Other Software:**
```
🎯 RECOMMENDED CHOICES:

✅ CHECK: "Normal installation" 
   (Full desktop environment with standard software)

✅ CHECK: "Download updates while installing Ubuntu"
   (Ensures latest security patches)

✅ CHECK: "Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats"
   (CRITICAL for ASUS hardware compatibility)

❌ UNCHECK: "Configure Secure Boot" (if it appears)
   (Can cause boot issues on some ASUS systems)

✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

---

## 💽 **INSTALLATION TYPE (CRITICAL SECTION)**

### **Installation Type Screen:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL CHOICES:

For Bill's ASUS System with Existing Windows:

✅ SELECT: "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager"
   (Safest option - Ubuntu handles partitioning)

OR if more control needed:

✅ SELECT: "Something else" 
   (Manual partitioning - advanced users only)

❌ NEVER SELECT: "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
   (Would delete Windows - catastrophic!)

❌ AVOID: "Replace Windows with Ubuntu"
   (Would delete Windows - catastrophic!)
```

### **Disk Selection Details:**
```
Expected Disk Layout for Bill's System:
- Primary Drive (C:): Windows system
- E: Drive (9.25TB): Target for Ubuntu

RECOMMENDED PARTITION SCHEME:
✅ Root (/): 50-100GB (minimum)
✅ Home (/home): Remaining space
✅ Swap: 16GB (half of RAM, or 32GB max)

If using "Something else":
1. SELECT: E: drive (larger drive)
2. CREATE: New partition table if needed
3. ADD: Root partition (ext4, mount point /)
4. ADD: Swap partition (swap area)
5. ADD: Home partition (ext4, mount point /home)
```

## 🌐 **NETWORK AND LOCATION**

### **Wi-Fi Setup:**
```
✅ SELECT: Your Wi-Fi network
✅ ENTER: Wi-Fi password
✅ CLICK: "Continue"

If ethernet connected:
✅ AUTOMATICALLY: Will be detected
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Time Zone:**
```
✅ SELECT: Your location on the map
   (Should auto-detect based on network)
✅ VERIFY: Correct time zone shown
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

---

## 👤 **USER ACCOUNT SETUP**

### **Who Are You Screen:**
```
🎯 RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:

✅ Your name: "Bill" (or full name)
✅ Computer name: "bill-ubuntu" or "bill-asus-ubuntu"
✅ Username: "bill" (lowercase, no spaces)
✅ Password: [Strong password - Bill's choice]
✅ Confirm password: [Same password]

LOGIN OPTIONS:
✅ SELECT: "Require my password to log in"
   (More secure than automatic login)

❌ AVOID: "Log in automatically"
   (Security risk, especially for business use)

✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```
