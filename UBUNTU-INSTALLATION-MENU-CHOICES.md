**For:** Bill's ASUS system dual-boot setup  
**Context:** After fixing boot crash with `nomodeset acpi=off` parameters  
**Goal:** Successful Ubuntu installation alongside Windows without data loss

---

## 🚀 **BOOT MENU CHOICES**

### **Initial GRUB Menu (From USB):**
```
✅ SELECT: "Try or Install Ubuntu"
❌ AVOID: "Ubuntu (safe graphics)" (unless boot parameters don't work)

IMPORTANT: Press 'e' to edit and add boot parameters if needed:
- Add: nomodeset acpi=off

```

## 🌍 **UBUNTU 24.04 INSTALLER SCREENS**

### **Screen 1: Language Selection:**
```
✅ SELECT: "English" (or Bill's preferred language)
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Screen 2: Accessibility Options (NEW in 24.04):**
```
✅ CONFIGURE: Any accessibility needs (Large text, High contrast, etc.)
✅ OR SKIP: If no accessibility needs
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Screen 3: Keyboard Layout:**
```
✅ SELECT: "English (US)" (or Bill's layout)
✅ TEST: Type in the test box to verify
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Screen 4: Network Connection:**
```
✅ CONNECT: To Wi-Fi network (recommended for updates)
✅ OR SELECT: "Connect later" if using ethernet
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Screen 5: Installation Type Selection:**
```
🎯 CRITICAL CHOICE:

✅ SELECT: "Interactive Installation"
   (Classic step-by-step guide - what Bill needs)

❌ AVOID: "Automated Installation" 
   (Requires .yaml configuration file)

✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

### **Screen 6: Software Selection:**
```
🎯 RECOMMENDED CHOICES FOR BILL:

✅ SELECT: "Extended selection"
   (Full installation with all default apps including LibreOffice)

❌ AVOID: "Default selection" 
   (Minimal installation without office suite - too limited)

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS:
✅ CHECK: "Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware"
   (CRITICAL for ASUS hardware compatibility)

✅ CHECK: "Download updates while installing"
   (Ensures latest security patches)

✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

---

## 💽 **DISK CONFIGURATION (CRITICAL SECTION)**

### **Screen 7: Disk Configuration - MOST IMPORTANT SCREEN:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL CHOICES FOR BILL'S DUAL-BOOT:

OPTIONS YOU'LL SEE:

✅ SELECT: "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager"
   (SAFEST - Automatic dual-boot setup)
   ⚠️  NOTE: Only appears if Windows is properly detected

✅ ALTERNATIVE: "Manual Installation" 
   (If "alongside Windows" not available - gives full control)

❌ NEVER SELECT: "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
   (Would delete Windows - catastrophic data loss!)

🎯 WHAT TO DO:
1. If you see "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager" - SELECT IT
2. If you DON'T see it, select "Manual Installation"
3. Never select "Erase disk" unless you want to lose Windows
```

### **If You Selected "Manual Installation":**
```
🔧 MANUAL PARTITIONING (Advanced):

Bill's System Expected Layout:
- Disk 1 (C:): Windows system (don't touch!)
- Disk 2 (E:): 9.25TB target for Ubuntu

MANUAL STEPS:
1. SELECT: E: drive (9.25TB drive)
2. CLICK: "New Partition Table" if drive is empty
3. CREATE PARTITIONS:
   ✅ Root (/): 50-100GB, ext4 filesystem
   ✅ Swap: 16-32GB (match your RAM)
   ✅ Home (/home): Remaining space, ext4 filesystem

⚠️ CRITICAL: Don't modify Windows partitions on C: drive!
```

## 👤 **USER ACCOUNT SETUP**

### **Screen 8: User Account Creation (Before Time Zone in 24.04):**
```
🎯 BILL'S RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:

✅ Your name: "Bill" (or preferred full name)
✅ Computer name: "bill-ubuntu" or "bill-asus"
✅ Username: "bill" (lowercase, no spaces)
✅ Password: [Strong password - Bill's choice]
✅ Confirm password: [Same password]

LOGIN SECURITY:
✅ SELECT: "Require my password to log in"
   (More secure than automatic login)

❌ AVOID: "Log in automatically"
   (Security risk for business use)

✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

---

## 🌐 **TIME ZONE SELECTION**

### **Screen 9: Time Zone (After User Account in 24.04):**
```
✅ SELECT: Your location on the map
   (Should auto-detect based on network)
✅ VERIFY: Correct time zone displayed
✅ CLICK: "Continue"
```

## ⚙️ **INSTALLATION PROCESS**

### **Screen 10: Installation Progress:**
```

- Contact ASUS support for UEFI compatibility
```
