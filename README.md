## üöÄ QUICK START: From Zero to Hero

### Step 1: Set Up Claude Code (REQUIRED)

**Claude Code is the AI brain that makes this system work. You need the subscription CLI version, NOT the API.**

1. **Get Claude Code Subscription**:
   ```bash
   # Go to: https://claude.ai/code
   # Sign up for Claude Code subscription ($10/month as of 2024)
   # This gives you UNLIMITED usage with the CLI
   ```

2. **Install Claude Code CLI**:
   ```bash
   # For Linux/macOS:
   curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
   
   # For Windows (WSL recommended):
   # Install WSL first: wsl --install
   # Then run the Linux command above
   ```

3. **Authenticate Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude login
   # This opens your browser to authenticate
   # Follow the prompts to connect your subscription
   ```

4. **Test Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude "Hello, are you working?"
   # Should respond with a greeting
   ```

### Step 2: Install Bill Sloth System

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bill-sloth.git ~/bill-sloth
cd ~/bill-sloth

# Make everything executable
chmod +x lab.sh bin/* modules/*.sh

# Start the system
./lab.sh
```

### Step 3: Your First Commands

```bash
# Ask Claude Code to help you:
claude "Run the Bill Sloth lab from ~/bill-sloth"

# Or use specific modules:
claude "I want to set up my gaming system using Bill Sloth"
claude "Help me automate my repetitive tasks with Bill Sloth"
claude "Set up privacy tools using the Bill Sloth system"
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **You talk to Claude Code** in natural language
2. **Claude Code reads the modules** to understand available tools
3. **Interactive scripts guide you** through setup with education
4. **Everything is logged** so you can learn and review
5. **ATHF characters** make it fun and memorable
