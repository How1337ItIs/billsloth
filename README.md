## üéØ **What Is This Thing?**

Bill Sloth is like having Claude Code as your personal Linux tutor who:

- **Knows exactly what you need** before you even ask
- **Walks you through everything step-by-step** - no guessing
- **Explains WHY** you're doing something, not just HOW
- **Never judges you** for being confused or making mistakes
- **Makes Linux fun** instead of frustrating

Think of it as "Claude Code teaches you Linux" rather than "figure out Linux yourself."
