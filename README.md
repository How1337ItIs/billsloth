# 【BILL SLOTH】Linux Helper - Claude Code Edition

**TO USE: Tell Claude Code: "Run lab.sh from the billsloth repo"**

A git-based modular system designed to work WITH Claude Code, not replace it. Claude Code is the brain, these scripts are the muscle memory.

## 🧠 The Smart Approach

Instead of making Claude Code generate everything from scratch each time, we use version-controlled modules that Claude Code can read, understand, and execute intelligently.

## 🎌 Quick Start

Tell Claude Code to run this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/How1337ItIs/billsloth.git ~/BillSloth
cd ~/BillSloth
chmod +x lab.sh
./lab.sh
```

## 🔥 Architecture

- **Claude Code** = Brain/interpreter/decision maker
- **lab.sh** = Main interface that Claude Code presents
- **modules/** = Reusable scripts for common tasks
- **prompts/** = Context for Claude Code
- **shortcuts/** = Quick command definitions

## 🎯 Bill's Command Flow

1. Open terminal: `claude`
2. Say: "Run my lab" or "Start the Bill Sloth helper"
3. Claude Code reads and presents the interface
4. Claude Code executes chosen operations intelligently

## ⚡ Quick Commands for Claude Code

- `"Run my lab"` - Start main interface
- `"Fix audio"` - Audio troubleshooting
- `"Stream setup"` - OBS & streaming config
- `"Update everything"` - System maintenance
- `"Check VPN"` - Safety verification
- `"AI setup"` - Local AI models
- `"Game mode"` - Gaming optimization

## 🌟 Design Philosophy

### Token Efficiency
- Repetitive tasks → Local scripts (saves tokens)
- Complex decisions → Claude Code (provides intelligence)
- Common patterns → Reusable modules

### Claude Code Integration
- Scripts provide structure, Claude Code provides logic
- Error handling and decision-making by Claude Code
- Dynamic responses based on current system state
- Bill gets explanations in his language (anime references welcome)

## 🎮 Example Flow

```
Bill: "Claude, set up my streaming"

Claude Code:
1. Reads streaming_setup.sh structure
2. Checks current audio setup
3. Installs OBS if needed (with progress updates)
4. Configures scenes based on Bill's preferences
5. Creates shortcut commands
6. Explains everything with anime flair
```

## 🚀 Smart Shortcuts

Instead of complex commands, Bill says simple things:
```
Bill: "cc game"     → Claude Code optimizes for gaming
Bill: "cc stream"   → Claude Code starts streaming setup
Bill: "cc ai"       → Claude Code launches AI playground
Bill: "cc fix"      → Claude Code diagnoses and fixes issues
```

## 🎌 Bill-Specific Features

- **Dyslexia-friendly**: Claude Code is forgiving with typos
- **Anime aesthetic**: Terminal art and references
- **Learning mode**: Claude Code explains what it's doing
- **Safety first**: VPN checks before torrenting
- **One-click shortcuts**: Complex tasks → simple commands

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is NOT a standalone system
- Every interaction goes through Claude Code
- Claude Code provides intelligence, scripts provide efficiency
- Bill interacts with Claude Code, not directly with scripts
- Perfect for learning Linux while having fun

## 🔧 For Claude Code Users

When Bill asks you to use this system:
1. Read the relevant module files for structure
2. Use your intelligence to make decisions
3. Execute the appropriate scripts
4. Explain what you're doing in Bill's language
5. Create shortcuts for future use

**Remember**: You're the brain, these scripts are your tools. Use them to help Bill efficiently while teaching him along the way.
