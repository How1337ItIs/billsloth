- **Walks you through everything step-by-step** - no guessing
- **Explains WHY** you're doing something, not just HOW
- **Never judges you** for being confused or making mistakes

## 🚨 **What To Do If Things Go Wrong**

**If Claude Code won't start:**
```bash
# Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and try these commands one by one:

# Check if Node.js is installed:
node --version
# Should show v18 or higher. If not, install it:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Check if Claude Code is installed:
claude --version
# If this fails, reinstall Claude Code:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Try logging out and back in:
claude logout
claude login

# Test it's working:
claude "Are you there?"
```

**If you get permission errors:**
```bash
# You might need to fix npm permissions:
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Then reinstall Claude Code:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### **Bill Sloth Module Issues?**

claude "The Bill Sloth gaming module isn't working, can you help me debug it?"

pwd         # Show where you are

# Copy and paste in Terminal:
# Ctrl+Shift+C to copy
# Ctrl+Shift+V to paste (NOT Ctrl+V!)

# If a command asks for password:
# Type your password (you won't see it as you type - this is normal)
# Press Enter
```
