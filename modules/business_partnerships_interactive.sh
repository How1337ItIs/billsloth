• [MUTUAL_BENEFIT - e.g., cross-promotion opportunities]

Next Steps:
I'd love to schedule a 15-20 minute call to discuss how we can work together. Are you available for a brief conversation next week?

I'm confident we can create something valuable that benefits both our organizations and audiences.
